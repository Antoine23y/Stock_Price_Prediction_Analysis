# 📈 Stock Price Predictor

## Overview
This project predicts future stock prices using historical market data and machine learning models.
The goal is to explore time-series forecasting and evaluate model performance on real financial data.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## How To Install
- pip install yfinance
- pip install pandas
- pip install numpy
- pip install scikit-learn
- pip install matplotlib
- pip install jupyter



## How It Works
1. Historical stock price data is loaded and cleaned
2. Features are engineered from time-series data
3. A regression model is trained
4. Predictions are evaluated using error metrics

## Results
The model achieves reasonable short-term prediction accuracy but struggles with long-term volatility, highlighting the challenges of financial forecasting.
